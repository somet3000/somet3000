### Hi, I'm Karthik! Welcome to my GitHub!

---

I am currently a first-year graduate student in the Tri-Institutional PhD program in Computational Biology and Medicine (joint between Weill Cornell Medical College, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, and Cornell University). I was previously an undergraduate student at UC San Diego where I double majored in Data Science and General Biology. I also worked in the McVicker Lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. My research interests include developing novel statistical methods to understanding gene regulation. For fun, I enjoy playing tennis, running, strumming the guitar, and watching football/basketball!
